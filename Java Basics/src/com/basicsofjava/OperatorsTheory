What is Operator?
Operator is nothing but a Symbol that is used to Perform Operations.
They are many  types of operators in java
*Unary Operator:-
    postfix         	expr++ expr--
    prefix          	++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !
    The java  Unary Operators required only one operand.Unary operators are used to perform various Operations
        1-> Increment/Decrement a value by one
        2-> negating an expression
        3->Inverting the value of boolean
*Shift Operator:-
    shift           	<< >> >>>
    Left shift Operator:-
    The Java left shift operator << is used to shift all of the bits in a value to the left side of a specified number of times.
    Right shift Operator:-
    The Java right shift operator >> is used to move the value of the left operand to right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
*Arithmetic  Operator:-
    multiplicative	        * / %
    additive	               + -
    Java arithmetic operators are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They act as basic mathematical operations.
*Relational Operator:-
    comparison	            < > <= >= instance of
    equality	            == !=
*Logical Operator:-
    logical AND	        &&
    The logical && operator doesn't check the second condition if the first condition is false. It checks the second condition only if the first one is true.

    The bitwise & operator always checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.
    logical OR	        ||
    The logical || operator doesn't check the second condition if the first condition is true. It checks the second condition only if the first one is false.

    The bitwise | operator always checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.
*Bitwise Operator:-
    bitwise AND             	&
    The bitwise & operator always checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.
    bitwise exclusive OR	    ^
    bitwise inclusive OR	    |
    The bitwise | operator always checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.
*Ternary Operator:-
    ternary	        ? :
    Java Ternary operator is used as one line replacement for if-then-else statement and used a lot in Java programming. It is the only conditional operator which takes three operands.
*Assignment Operator:-
    assignment	            = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=

    Java assignment operator is one of the most common operators. It is used to assign the value on its right to the operand on its left.
